                       <h1>Web Design</h1>
                       <p>We believe in creating websites that are effective, not ones that just look pretty. There is no point to an overly designed website if a user can't find some simple contact information anywhere. A professional design mixed with user-centered goals is our main focus as we design and develop your new website. The real way to measure a website is not only by its design awards (which are nice) but by it's effectiveness in helping a business grow.</p>

                           <p class="text-justify">
                               The most efficient way for us to get a website done is to understand who you are. Every project begins with a thorough discussion about every detail of your project from design to functionality. There is no wasted time on coming up with random design comps that are nowhere near what you like because the initial consultation will give us a clear road map for what you are looking for.<br /><br /><br />

                           <p class="text-justify">
                               Who your website is intended for is a key factor in how it is designed. If you are targeting an older audience, larger fonts, simple graphics, and ease-of-use are some of the design elements we would incorporate. A flashy website with constantly moving objects confuses users who are trying to gather information about you and your business quickly. We aim to get a clear understanding of your targeted audience and put together a website that will give them what they want.

                               As we work on your website, we always keep in mind that this is your website, not ours. We want it to be something you are absolutely proud of and show off to all your colleagues. You will get our professional opinion and expertise, but never an ego that will only do what we want to do.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
