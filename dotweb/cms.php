                       <h2>Why WordPress?</h2>
                       <p>We have played with many CMS available both free, open-source and paid. One of the primary reasons we like WordPress is because of it's huge community which improves the core functionality very quickly. They also provide a large plugin directory which extends the possibilities of WordPress with features like calendar systems, advanced contact forms and so much more.</p>
                       <p>Also important is the ease-of-use in the administration area for our clients. We don't want to hand over a website for you to maintain that requires a degree in Computer Science or even much training at all. Many of our clients don't require any help from us to learn how to manage their website content with WordPress.</p>
